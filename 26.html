<h2  style ="font-family:arial;color:orange">Early life[edit]</h2>
Sunidhi Chauhan was born on 14 August 1983, in New Delhi, India in a Rajput family.[1] Her father, Dushyant Kumar Chauhan, who is from Uttar Pradesh, is a theatre personality at the Shriram Bharatiya Kala Kendra.[2] Her mother, a homemaker, inclined Chauhan to persuade a career in music.[2] She also has a younger sister.[2] At the age of four, Chauhan started performing at competitions and local gatherings, subsequently convinced by her father's friends to take singing seriously.[1] During that time, she was doing live shows and trained herself with "regular riyaaz by listening to cassettes and CDs of popular numbers".[3]
She did her studies from Greenfields Public School and used to stay with her family members.[4][5] She discontinued studies right after schooling to pursue a career in the music industry.[6] She said: "I quit because I did not feel like studying. I made the decision to pursue my dream as a singer and I don't regret it one bit".[7]
When actress Tabassum spotted her, she made her sing live in her show Tabassum Hit Parade and asked her family to shift to Mumbai.[8] She then introduced Chauhan to Kalyanji Virji Shah and Anandji Virji Shah.[9] When she was 11, her dad quit his career and brought her to Mumbai. Initially, the family had financial difficulties in adjusting life to the city. After shifting there, she worked in Kalyanji's academy for few years and became the lead singer in his "Little Wonders" troupe.[10] She was then offered with many shows, though her father insisted on singing for films.[1]

So she sang the song with that slightly broken voice".[22]

In 2001, Chauhan was featured in four tracks from the album of Ajnabee. Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com described Chauhan's rendition of Adnan Sami-duet "Mehbooba Mehbooba" as "saucy", and Kumar Sanu-duet "Meri Zindagi Mein" as "mundane rendition" but criticized the next two tracks; "Mujhko Neend Aa Rahi Hai" and "Kasam Se Teri Aankhen" as she is heard "bored" and "fall flat".[23] She credited Malik for playing a major role in her "evolution", as he "fought" with the producers to give her the songs, because of that she was "accepted in typical heroines romantic numbers".[8] She then lend her voice for "Ek Baar Pyar" for Anand Raj Anand and "Yeh Kaisa Ehsaas Hai" for Milind Sagar; both from Ehsaas: The Feeling and duet with Nigam.[24] Besides, she was heard in Malik's Yaadein; "Alaap", "Jab Dil Miley" and "Yaadein Yaad Aati Hain" were critically acclaimed.[25]

D.

Kreem for Sur – The Melody of Life, where she performed "Aa Bhi Ja" and "Dil Mein Jaagi Dhadkan Aise"; which she considered "hummable" and different from her "usual style".[28][15] According to Priyanka Bhattacharya, "Chauhan's matured rendition surprises in the second half of "Aa Bhi Ja" and mentioned that other track is also "equally good".[28]
Chauhan made her second screen appearance in 2003 with Ram Gopal Varma-directed Bhoot, where she was featured in the promotional music video of "Bhoot Hoon Main", composed by Salim–Sulaiman.[29] According to Malik, he roped in Chauhan to playback for Kareena Kapoor in two song of Main Prem Ki Diwani Hoon, since "Chauhan came in for the passion, as she understands [him] in such songs".[30][31] She later worked with him for the song "Dekh Le" from Munna Bhai M.B.B.S..[32] Her second collaboration with Sandesh Shandilya was released in 2004, with Chameli.[33] She performed six tracks for the album, out of which Chauhan received most recognition with the songs "Bhaage Re Mann" and "Sajna Ve Sajna". Chauhan's higher octave "carefree delivery" of the former was appreciated by the critics while she chose the latter as her "personal favorite" song in her career.[34][35]
Chauhan received her third Filmfare nomination for Best Female Playback Singer for the song "Dhoom Machaale" from Dhoom (2004), which was both critically and commercially appreciated.[18] Besides, Chauhan performed four tracks for Garv, composed by Sajid-Wajid.[36] However, music critics labelled her "stereotyped" and noted that "all her songs sound alike".[36] And "Saiyan" from Garv is "no different" from A.R. Rahman-composed "Saiyyan" of Nayak (2001).[36] One of the dance numbers released during the year was "Aisa Jadoo" from Khakee composed by Ram Sampath, followed by "Ishq Kabhi Kario Na" and "Saaki" from Musafir.[37][38] Reportedly, Sampath asked Chauhan to stand two feet away from the mike while recording the song "Aisa Jadoo", as the "equipment couldn’t handle her pumped-up voice throw".[39] In her review of Musafir, Verma wrote: "Chauhan's husky vocals do complete justice to "Ishq Kabhi Kario Na" by adding just the right amount of sauciness and oomph".[40]
2005, marked the first collaboration of Chauhan with composer Shantanu Moitra where she recorded "Aao Nee Kudiyon" for 7½ Phere and the seductive track "Kaisi Paheli Zindagani" for Parineeta.[41] Sahaya Ranjit from India Today called her voice a "westernised edge" and "sensuous texture" with a jazz influence in her rendition.[42] Apart from recording the Rajasthani folk influenced "Phir Raat Kati" in Paheli, alongside Sukhwinder Singh, she was heard in a slow pace club number "Jadoo" from Padmashree Laloo Prasad Yadav.[43][44] During the year, she performed with Abhishek Bachchan in Vishal-Shekhar's composition, "Right Here Right Now" from Bluffmaster!.[45] She worked with Vishal-Shekhar in few other compositions including Dus (2005) and Shabd (2005).[46] She was heard in "Chahaton Ka Silsila"—duet with Kumar Sanu, "Khoya Khoya"—duet with Sonu Nigam and "Sholon Si"—duet with Vishal Dadlani, from Shabd.[47] Chauhan received two more Filmfare award nominations for her rendition of the song "Deedar De" from Dus and "Kaisi Paheli Zindagani" of Parineeta.[48] Apparently, Sonu Nigam picked her as the most outstanding voice of 2005, for her rendition of those songs.
